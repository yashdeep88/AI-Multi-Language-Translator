## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository or navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd c:\ai_tran\ai_translator
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    # source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: Depending on your OS, you might need to install `ffmpeg` for `pydub` and Whisper to work correctly with audio files. On Windows, download the binaries and add them to your PATH. On Ubuntu: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`.*

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
2.  Open your browser to the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
    *Note: The first time you run a translation or transcribe audio, the models (NLLB, Whisper) will be downloaded from Hugging Face which might take some time and disk space depending on your internet connection.*
